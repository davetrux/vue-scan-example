This is a sample application used as part of [a blog post](https://davidtruxall.com/add-vulnerability-scanning-to-your-vue-ci/)  demonstrating the use of the OWASP Depdendency Scanner on a Vue.js application, and also [a second blog post](https://davidtruxall.com/add-vulnerability-scanning-to-your-vue-ci/) describing how to use it in a CI/CD build pipeline.
